            "text": "\"Lead Safe\" is an API available to Chicago-area hospital and health networks to estimate  the likelihood that a child will be exposed to lead-based paint hazards. Health network providers can provide information on the patient's demographics, address, and history on their past visits and blood-lead levels, the Lead Safe API will provide an estimate of the risk of elevated, unsafe blood-lead levels for children under 4 years-old.\n\n\nThe API uses a predictive model developed by the University of Chicago\n1\n that uses historical blood-lead level testing conducted by the State of Illinois. Data submitted through this API and subsequent testing conducted will improve the accuracy of the model, allowing for a more effective use of blood tests to prevent elevated lead levels.\n\n\nObtaining Access\n\n\nEligibility\n\n\nTo access the API, fill out \nthis form\n to be contacted by the Chicago Department of Public Health. The city will need to verify your eligiblity as an area health provider.\n\n\nAccessing API\n\n\nIn order to integrate with Lead Safe, the health provider will need to make a REST call against the API. To do so, they will be provided an API token which will provide some authentication. The city will also need to \"whitelist\" the IP address(es) of the health providers servers.\n\n\nAPI\n\n\nSubmitting Patient Record\n\n\nSubmit a patient record and retrieve the estimated risk of having elevated blood-lead levels.\n\n\nPOST {json file} \nurl\n/insert/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nFormat\n\n\nConstraints\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\nTimeDate\n\n\nyyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.sss-hh:mm\n\n\nCurrent timestamp (RFC 3339 complient date)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnetwork_id\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nThe parent entity of the submitting organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclinic_id\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nOrganization ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocation_id\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nSpecific Location Abbreviation in Centricity\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatient_id\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nAlphaNumeric patient identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n\naddress1\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nPatient home address (street number, street direction, street name, street type)\n\n\n\n\n\n\naddress2\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nPatient home address (additional information, e.g. apartment number)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncity\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nPatient home address city\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstate\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nPatient home address state\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzip\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nPatient home address zip code\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate_of_birth\n\n\nDate\n\n\nyyyy-mm-dd\n\n\nPatient date of birth\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngender\n\n\nText\n\n\nM/F/U\n\n\nPatient gender\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrace\n\n\nText\n\n\nCode Values from Centricity\n\n\nStandard ONC Race definitions \n \n \nCode / description\n \n 1002-5 / American Indian or Alaska Native \n 2028-9 / Asian \n 2054-5 / Black or African American \n 2076-8 / Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander \n 2106-3 / White \n UNK / Unknown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nethnicity\n\n\nText\n\n\nCode Values from Centricity\n\n\nStandard ONC Ethnicity definitions \n \n \nCode / description\n \n 2135-2 / Hispanic or Latino \n 2186-5 / Non Hispanic or Latino \n UNK / Unknown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVISIT ARRAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional\n May entirely omit the array if visit history does not exist or is unavailable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvisit.visit_id\n\n\nNumeric\n\n\n16 Digit GE ID\n\n\nUnique GE ID for specific visit (DocumentID)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvisit.date\n\n\nDate\n\n\nyyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.sss-hh:mm\n\n\nDate of visit (RFC 3339 complient date)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvisit.location\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nText Abbreviation for facility of visit location\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvisit.provider\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nFull provider name, last name, or just NPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLAB ARRAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional\n May entirely omit the array if visit history does not exist or is unavailable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlab.lab_id\n\n\nNumeric\n\n\n16 Digit GE ID\n\n\nUnique GE ID for specific lab result (ObsID)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlab.type\n\n\nText\n\n\n\"BLL\"\n\n\nStatic BLL unless we identify additional labs to include\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlab.date\n\n\nDate\n\n\nyyyy-mm-dd\n\n\nDate of lab results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlab.sample_type\n\n\nText\n\n\nV/C\n\n\n\"V\" Venous \n \"C\" for Capillary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlab.result\n\n\nText\n\n\nN/A>\n\n\nSeveral values are possible;
