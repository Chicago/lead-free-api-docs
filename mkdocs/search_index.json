            "text": "\"Lead Safe\" is an API available to Chicago-area hospital and health networks to estimate the likelihood that a child will be exposed to lead-based paint hazards. Health network providers can provide information on the patient's demographics, address, and history on their past visits and blood-lead levels, the Lead Safe API will provide an estimate of the risk of elevated, unsafe blood-lead levels for children under 4 years-old.\n\n\nThe API uses a predictive model developed by the University of Chicago\n1\n that uses historical blood-lead level testing conducted by the State of Illinois. Data submitted through this API and subsequent testing conducted will improve the accuracy of the model, allowing for a more effective use of blood tests to prevent elevated lead levels.\n\n\nObtaining Access\n\n\nEligibility\n\n\nTo access the API, fill out \nthis form\n to be contacted by the Chicago Department of Public Health. The city will need to verify your eligibility as an area health provider.\n\n\nAccessing API\n\n\nIn order to integrate with Lead Safe, the health provider will need to make a REST call against the API. To do so, they will be provided an API token which will provide some authentication. The city will also need to \"whitelist\" the IP address(es) of the health providers servers.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n\nThe \"Lead Safe\" API was developed by the \nChicago Department of Public Health\n, University of Chicago's \nCenter for Data Science and Public Policy\n, and the \nChicago Department of Innovation and Technology\n.

Local non-profits, such as (INSERT NAME OF NON-PROFITS). Families who rent their home from a landlord can also contact the City of Chicago for inspectors to inspect their homes for potential sources of lead poisoning.

This may result in decreased academic achievement and IQ, increased risk of attention-related and problem behaviors, and decreased hearing. Lead can also effect a child\u2019s growth.\n\n\nHow are most children in Chicago exposed to lead?\n\n\nIn Chicago, children are most likely to be exposed to lead while living or staying in older homes or apartments that have lead paint. Most homes built before 1978 (when lead paint was banned in the U.S.) have some lead paint on the inside and outside of the building. When old paint cracks and peels, it makes lead dust. Lead dust is so small you cannot see it or smell it. Children may get lead poisoning from swallowing or breathing in lead dust on their hands and toys.\n\n\nWhat are other ways children can be exposed to lead?\n\n\nLead can also be found in soil, water, pots, containers, candy, folk medicine, cosmetics made in other countries, and some toys and toy jewelry. For up-to-date information on recalls of toys and other products that contain lead you can check \nhttp://www.cpsc.gov\n.\n\n\nWho is at greatest risk of lead poisoning in Chicago?\n\n\nWe worry most about young children (especially ages 0-3, but up to age 6) both because their brains are developing rapidly and because they are more likely to put their hands and objects contaminated with lead dust into their mouths. Children who live in older, poorly maintained homes or apartments or who have parents who are exposed to lead at work or through other activities are also at increased risk for lead poisoning.\n\n\nHow do I know if my child has lead poisoning?\n\n\nA simple blood test is the only way to know if your child has lead poisoning. Most\nchildren who have lead poisoning do not look or act sick.\n\n\nAre there any foods that help prevent lead poisoning?\n\n\nGiving your child healthy foods is important for healthy development and is also helpful for preventing lead poisoning. Foods with calcium, iron, and Vitamin C can help keep lead out of the body. Calcium is in milk, yogurt, cheese, and leafy green vegetables like spinach. Iron is in red meats, beans, peanut butter, and cereals. Vitamin C is in oranges, green and red peppers, and juice. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about this.\n\n\nWhat else can I do to protect my child from lead exposure inside my home?\n\n\nHousehold dust is a major source of lead. Windowsills and window wells, in particular, can contain a lot of leaded dust. Clean your home weekly. Use a solution of water and cleaner to wet-mop floors and to wipe windowsills and other surfaces. Don\u2019t reuse cloths or sponges on dishes or counters. Don\u2019t dry-dust, sweep, or vacuum as these activities can spread lead dust. Remove shoes prior to entering the home. Wash hands and toys often with soap and water and always wash hands before eating and sleeping. When possible, windows should be shut to prevent abrasion of painted surfaces. In addition, parents who work in auto repair, construction, or plumbing, or who make stained glass or use firing ranges can carry lead dust on themselves, so they should shower and change clothes before interacting with young children.\n\n\nIs there any financial assistance available to fix lead hazards in my home or apartment?\n\n\nYes. CDPH has a program available that can provide financial assistance to fix lead hazards. \nFor more information, please call (312) 747-LEAD (5323).\n\n\nFor additional information visit:\n \nhttps://www.epa.gov/lead/learn-about-lead#lower\n or \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/",

Esto puede provocar una disminuci\u00f3n en los logros acad\u00e9micos y el CI, mayor riesgo de comportamientos problem\u00e1ticos y relacionados a la atenci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como disminuci\u00f3n en la audici\u00f3n. El plomo tambi\u00e9n puede afectar el crecimiento de un ni\u00f1o. \n\n\n\u00bfDe qu\u00e9 manera est\u00e1 expuesta al plomo la mayor\u00eda de los ni\u00f1os en Chicago?\n\n\nEn Chicago, es m\u00e1s com\u00fan que los ni\u00f1os est\u00e9n expuestos al plomo mientras viven o se quedan en casas antiguas o apartamentos que tienen pintura a base de plomo. La mayor\u00eda de las casas construidas antes de 1978 (cuando la pintura a base de plomo fue prohibida en los Estados Unidos) tiene algo de pintura a base de plomo en el interior y exterior del edificio. Cuando la pintura vieja se agrieta o se levanta, crea polvo de plomo. El polvo de plomo es tan diminuto que no se puede ver ni oler. Los ni\u00f1os pueden intoxicarse con plomo al tragar o respirar el polvo de plomo que est\u00e1 en sus manos y juguetes.\n\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1les son otras formas en las que los ni\u00f1os pueden estar expuestos al plomo?\n\n\nEl plomo puede encontrarse tambi\u00e9n en la tierra, el agua, las\nollas, los contenedores, los dulces, la medicina popular y los cosm\u00e9ticos hechos en otros pa\u00edses, al igual que algunos juguetes y joyer\u00eda de juguete. Para obtener informaci\u00f3n actualizada sobre los juguetes y otros productos que pueden contener plomo, puede buscar en \nhttp://www.cpsc.gov\n.\n\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1l es el mayor riesgo de envenenamiento por plomo en Chicago?\n\n\nNos preocupamos m\u00e1s por los ni\u00f1os m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os (especialmente de 0 a 3\na\u00f1os de edad, pero hasta 6 a\u00f1os) tanto porque sus cerebros est\u00e1n desarroll\u00e1ndose r\u00e1pidamente como porque ellos son quienes m\u00e1s com\u00fanmente meten sus manos y objetos contaminados con polvo de plomo en sus bocas. Los ni\u00f1os que viven en casas o apartamentos m\u00e1s antiguos y que reciben un mal mantenimiento o cuyos padres est\u00e1n expuestos al plomo en el trabajo o mediante otras actividades, tambi\u00e9n corren un mayor riesgo de envenenamiento por plomo.\n\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo s\u00e9 si mi hijo tiene envenenamiento por plomo?\n\n\nUn sencillo examen de sangre es la \u00fanica forma de saber si su hijo tiene envenenamiento por plomo. La mayor\u00eda de los ni\u00f1os que padece envenenamiento por plomo no se ven ni act\u00faan como si estuvieran enfermos.\n\n\n\u00bfExisten algunos alimentos que puedan ayudar a prevenir el envenenamiento por plomo?\n\n\nEs importante darle alimentos saludables a su hijo para que tenga un desarrollo sano y esto tambi\u00e9n ayudar\u00e1 a prevenir el envenenamiento por plomo. Los alimentos que contienen calcio, hierro y vitamina C pueden ayudar a mantener el plomo fuera del cuerpo. El calcio se encuentra en la leche, el yogur, el queso y los vegetales de hojas verdes como la espinaca. El hierro se encuentra en las carnes rojas, los frijoles, la mantequilla de man\u00ed y los cereales. La vitamina C se encuentra en las naranjas, los chiles pimientos verdes y rojos, y el jugo. Si tiene alguna pregunta acerca de este aviso, consulte a su doctor.\n\n\n\u00bfEn qu\u00e9 otra forma puedo proteger a mi hijo contra la exposici\u00f3n al plomo dentro de mi casa?\n\n\nEl polvo dom\u00e9stico es la fuente principal del plomo. Las repisas y los huecos de las ventanas, en particular, pueden contener mucho polvo de plomo. Limpie su casa semanalmente. Use una soluci\u00f3n de agua y un producto de limpieza para trapear los pisos con el trapeador mojado y para limpiar las repisas de las ventanas y otras superficies. No vuela a usar trapos o esponjas en los platos o mostradores. No barra el piso con el polvo en seco, ni aspire ya que estas actividades pueden esparcir el polvo de plomo.

You understand and agree that these TOS constitute a legally binding agreement between you and the City. You represent that you have full authority to accept these TOS. If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent that you have full authority to bind your employer or such other entity to the TOS.\n\n\nIn these TOS, \u201cYou\u201d or \u201cYour\u201d refers to any individual or entity that uses or seeks to use the API Services and Data.\n\n\nCurrent Practice\n\n\nPediatricians are directed to test every Chicago child\u2019s blood for lead and report high levels to the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the reference level of 5 micrograms/dL should be used to identify children with elevated blood lead levels and is based on U.S. children between the ages of 1 - 5 years old based on the 97.5th percentile of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of blood lead distribution in children.\n\n\nThough lead is no longer used in paint, plumbing, gasoline and a myriad of other products in the United States, Chicago\u2019s older housing stock creates a persistent problem as homes built prior to 1978 that have not been properly maintained may still have older paint that can result in exposure to lead in children. This is especially true in some communities on the south and west sides of Chicago.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nTo ensure success in the fight against lead poisoning, this project is part of CDPH's overall plan to provide concrete steps that are being taken by the department and its partners to further reduce and eventually eliminate lead poisoning in Chicago\u2019s children.\n\n\nThis lead safe predictive model helps identify infants at risk of being lead poisoned in homes with lead paint. The model provides an opportunity to prevent lead paint exposure through high priority proactive home lead inspections and blood testing at an earlier age. The predictive model combines data from multiple sectors including public health, census, buildings and the county assessor\u2019s office to create real-time interfaces that identify where at-risk children live.\n\n\nThe risk score, will be sent to health centers through electronic health records (EHR) and physicians will have the opportunity to be alerted to either order a blood lead test and/or request to visually inspect the homes of either their pregnant patients and their at-risk children for lead paint hazards.\n\n\nIf the visual inspection determines that there is a risk of lead poisoning due to paint, the CDPH Healthy Homes and Lead Prevention Program lead inspectors schedule a visit and examine for potential lead paint hazards. Trained and licensed CDPH inspectors assess these homes to identify lead-based paint hazards and work with the property owners to ensure the hazards are fixed. CDPH Inspectors support this by offering free lead-safe work practices classes in both English and Spanish, or face fines and a referral to Circuit Court. Through grants made available by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Cook County Department of Public Health, CDPH, in cooperation with Neighborhood Housing Services, provides 100% financial assistance to fix lead-based paint hazards in eligible homes. A unique aspect of the HUD grant is that tenants can apply. Since 2003, CDPH has helped ensure lead hazards have been fixed in more than 2,800 homes. CDPH has also launched a community outreach program aimed at providing additional information to residents in communities facing a disproportionate number of lead poisoning cases. As part of this program, CDPH is working with Imagine Englewood If and the Metropolitan Tenants Organization to provide education and information to pregnant women and families with young children as well as perform visual inspections by trained staff.\n\n\nMedical Disclaimer\n\n\nThis prediction model is only for pregnant patients and infants (defined as 0-1 year of age), thus risk scores will be provided only to pregnant patients and infants under one year of age. According to the \nCDC\n, \"by shifting our focus to primary prevention of lead exposure, we can reduce or eliminate dangerous lead sources in children\u2019s environments before they are exposed.\" Reference \n\"Preventing Lead Exposure in Young Children: A Housing Based Approach to Primary Prevention of Lead Poisoning.\"\n\n\nThis information is meant to aid clinical reasoning. No medical decision should be based solely on information provided by this program. By using this information, the user shall indemnify and hold harmless the developers of this program from and against any claims, demands, or causes of action whatsoever.\n\n\nApplication Process (needs HIPAA Officer and CDO edits)\n\n\nIn order to obtain risk scores from the Lead Safe system, you must complete a form to request an API key. Once You have submitted Your completed form, You will automatically receive an API key for the Test API system, which You may then use to develop Your application. An API key is not required to read data only: if You intend to read data only you do not need to request an API key. Nevertheless, any and all use of the API is subject to these TOS even if an API key is not required.\n\n\nOnce You successfully integrate Your application with Chicago\u2019s Test System, You may request an API key for the Production system. The City, in its sole and complete discretion, may give You an API key and access to the API. Upon submitting Your request You will receive an un-activated Production API Key. The City will review Your application to ensure compliance with the API Terms of Service. Once this has been verified, You will be notified that Your Production Key has been activated and is ready for use.\n\n\nAccess to the Environment is subject to Your compliance with these terms as well as development of a privacy policy, including clear and conspicuous disclosure to users of any practice whereby You or a third party collect or use personally identifiable information from users. In addition, You agree to fully comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection of personally identifiable information, including personal health information and their associated privacy and security laws. Any violation of these requirements or failure to comply with Your privacy policy constitutes a violation of these TOS and is grounds for immediate termination of all access privileges to the API services and Data.\n\n\nAccess privileges to API services and Data are granted at the sole discretion of the City and may be restricted or terminated at any time.\n\n\nCity Policies and Requirements Regarding Use of API Services\n\n\nUsage is limited and will be monitored. Excessive usage, in the sole and complete discretion of the City, may be grounds for imposing usage caps or for termination of service. If You plan to make heavy use of the API service, please notify the City prior to such use. The City, in its complete discretion, may allow You to avoid limitations on usage.\n\n\nThe use of the API precludes healthcare provider(s) and all staff, including third-party contractors, from the healthcare facility from transferring data or publishing any results derived from its activities hereunder and will not disclose any results or other material based upon data provided by the City without written permission from the City.\n\n\nThe City reserves the right to track and publish aggregate statistics on usage per application.\n\n\nWhen using the API, attribution of the City as the API source is appreciated but not required. However, You and Your application must not express or imply any affiliation or relationship with or sponsorship or endorsement by the City.\n\n\nFurther, You may not use the City seal in your application in any way that may suggest that City is affiliated with, endorses, or sponsors you or your application.\n\n\nAny practice whereby information that is intended to be transmitted directly between the user and the City is manipulated, edited, redacted or otherwise processed by the application, such that the content or meaning of the information is altered, must be disclosed to the user in a clear and conspicuous manner.\n\n\nSharing, distribution, or any other intentional or unintentional disclosure of API keys to unauthorized users is not permitted and constitutes a violation of these TOS.\n\n\nYou agree to comply with, and use all means available to assist the City in complying with, state and local public records laws.\n\n\nAny activity that exceeds Your authorized access privileges to City API services and Data is strictly prohibited.\n\n\nConsequences of Violating The Terms of Service\n\n\nYou have a continuing obligation to comply with the Terms of Service (TOS). Any violation of the TOS may, in the City\u2019s sole and complete discretion, result in the immediate invalidation of Your API key and termination of all access privileges to API services and Data.\n\n\nExclusion of Warranties\n\n\nThe City does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness or availability of the API services and Data. You understand and agree that Your use of the API services and Data is at Your sole risk and that the API services and Data are made available on an \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cas available\u201d basis without any warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including without limitation implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Should there be an error, inaccuracy or other defect in the API services and Data, You assume the full cost of correcting any such error, inaccuracy or defect. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by You from the City or through or from the API services or data will create any warranty not expressly stated in these TOS.\n\n\nLimitation of Liability and Indemnity\n\n\nIn no event shall the City be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or special damages (including without limitation, loss of use, time or data, inconvenience, commercial loss, lost profits or savings, or the cost of computer equipment and software), to the full extent that such may be disclaimed by law, or for any claim against You by any third party. In no event shall the City be liable for any claim, including claims by third parties, for loss or damages arising from Your use of the API services and Data.\n\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, You shall indemnify and save harmless the City, from any claim, loss, damage, injury or liability of any kind, nature and description (including, without limitation, incidental and consequential damages, court costs, attorney\u2019s fees and costs of investigation), that arise directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from Your use of the API services and Data. In addition to Your obligation to indemnify the City, You specifically acknowledge and agree that You have an immediate and independent obligation to defend the City from any claim which actually or potentially falls within this indemnification provision, even if the allegations are or may be groundless, false or fraudulent, which obligation arises at the time such claim is tendered to You by the City and continues at all times thereafter.\n\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\n\nThe City retains the right to modify these TOS at any time by posting such modifications on this page. Any modification is effective upon posting, unless otherwise indicated. The City will attempt to provide reasonable advance notice of any such changes to developers who have been granted access to API Services and Data.

Though lead is no longer used in paint, plumbing, gasoline and a myriad of other products in the United States, Chicago\u2019s older housing stock creates a persistent problem as homes built prior to 1978 that have not been properly maintained may still have older paint that can result in exposure to lead in children.

This lead safe predictive model helps identify infants at risk of being lead poisoned in homes with lead paint. The model provides an opportunity to prevent lead paint exposure through high priority proactive home lead inspections and blood testing at an earlier age. The predictive model combines data from multiple sectors including public health, census, buildings and the county assessor\u2019s office to create real-time interfaces that identify where at-risk children live.  The risk score, will be sent to health centers through electronic health records (EHR) and physicians will have the opportunity to be alerted to either order a blood lead test and/or request to visually inspect the homes of either their pregnant patients and their at-risk children for lead paint hazards.  If the visual inspection determines that there is a risk of lead poisoning due to paint, the CDPH Healthy Homes and Lead Prevention Program lead inspectors schedule a visit and examine for potential lead paint hazards. Trained and licensed CDPH inspectors assess these homes to identify lead-based paint hazards and work with the property owners to ensure the hazards are fixed. CDPH Inspectors support this by offering free lead-safe work practices classes in both English and Spanish, or face fines and a referral to Circuit Court. Through grants made available by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Cook County Department of Public Health, CDPH, in cooperation with Neighborhood Housing Services, provides 100% financial assistance to fix lead-based paint hazards in eligible homes. A unique aspect of the HUD grant is that tenants can apply. Since 2003, CDPH has helped ensure lead hazards have been fixed in more than 2,800 homes. CDPH has also launched a community outreach program aimed at providing additional information to residents in communities facing a disproportionate number of lead poisoning cases. As part of this program, CDPH is working with Imagine Englewood If and the Metropolitan Tenants Organization to provide education and information to pregnant women and families with young children as well as perform visual inspections by trained staff.",
